---having clause

--- the having clause is used to apply a filter on the result of group by based on the 
--- specified conditon
--- the where clause places conditons on the  selected coulmns,whereas the  having 
-- clause places conditions on groups created by the group by clause

--- we will always use having conditon with group by

--- where clause is always with the select conditon
